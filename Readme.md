<h3>Overview</h3>

This repository contains preliminary code for controls and user interface for the development of a low-cost and open source mechanical ventilator. The efforts were sparked and focussed on the [Agorize Code-Life](https://www.agorize.com/en/challenges/code-life-challenge) challenge with the goal of attempting to reach MHRA standard. Currently the project is in a breadboard-prototype stage. The results from some initial tests can be found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEDPK-_iI5k&feature=youtu.be).

<h3>Mechanical documentation</h3>

The progress of our mechanical team including CAD files can be found on a shared [GoogleDrive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NizzwWwZXZCoxUGANdJ21YTWGLYV4FTL?usp=sharing).

<h3>Software releases</h3>

A first test pre-release can be found under releases. Its objective is to be able to install and run the User interface on a [Raspberry Pi 3B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/) together with a [7" touch screen](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-touch-display/). There are bugs that need to be fixed and it is not yet fully linked to the arduino controls. However, it can be used to test and get an idea of the user interaction as well as the layout/sizing for further development.
